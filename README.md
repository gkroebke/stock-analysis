## mod 2 challenge - Deliverable 2
1. Overview of Project: This project introduced fundmental programming/coding concepts in the context of Visual Basic for Application (VBA) in Excel. VBA is Microsoft's programming language for its programs, including Excel. Individuals can use VBAs to automate simple/repetitive/time-consuming tasks or preform complex analyses beyond the capabilities of standard spreadsheet techniques. By working with VBA we were exposed to concepts that are applicable across programming languages e.g. creating and defining variables, logic flow (loops, nested-loops, and conditionals), debugging, and refactoring code.
