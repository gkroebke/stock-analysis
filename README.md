# stock-analysis
## mod 2 challenge - Deliverable 2
### Overview of Project: 
This project introduced fundmental programming/coding concepts in the context of Visual Basic for Application (VBA) in Excel. VBA is Microsoft's programming language for its programs, including Excel. Individuals can use VBAs to automate simple/repetitive/time-consuming tasks or preform complex analyses beyond the capabilities of standard spreadsheet techniques. By working with VBA we were exposed to concepts that are applicable across programming languages e.g. creating and defining variables, logic flow (loops, nested-loops, and conditionals), debugging, and refactoring code.
### Results:

![2017 performance](https://github.com/gkroebke/stock-analysis/blob/main/All%20Stocks%202017.png)
![2018 performance](https://github.com/gkroebke/stock-analysis/blob/main/All%20Stocks%202018.png)

By glancing at the images above, we see that the market performed better in 2017 compared to 2018 as a majority of stocks had postive yearly return in 2017, meaning these stocks rose in value. TERP was the only stock with a negative yearly return for 2017. In 2018 a majority of stocks had a negative yearly return. ENPH and RUN stand-out as the two stocks with positive returns for 2018.

The images above show the execution times of the original script and refactored script.

### Summary
Advantages - Refractoring code can save time since you're editing existing code instead of starting from scratch. When refactoring you may figure out how to make the code more efficient by reducing the number of steps used or imporivng the logic of your arguments.
Disadvantages - As with any editing processes, refactoring takes time. In a professional settings, deadlines/budgets may not allow for the time/money needed to refactor.
